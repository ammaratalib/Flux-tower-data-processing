Eddy covariance (EC) flux data preprocessing code is used to clean, and filter raw EC measurements before further analysis. The eddy covariance method measures exchanges of gases (like carbon dioxide and water vapor) between the land surface and the atmosphere. However, raw EC data often contain noise, missing values, and errors due to sensor malfunctions, weather conditions, or site disturbances.

•	Key Functions of Eddy Covariance Flux Data Preprocessing Code
•	Data Quality Control & Filtering
•	Gap Filling
•	Coordinate Rotation & Flux Corrections
•	Time Synchronization & Averaging:
•	Flux Partitioning:
•	Separates net ecosystem exchange (NEE) into its components:
•	Gross primary productivity (GPP)
•	Ecosystem respiration (Reco)
•	Uses nighttime-based respiration models or light-response curve methods.
